description: "Keeping Blessing Hill is the story of how two very flawed people built a welcoming home out of a dilapidated barn, turned a wildly overgrown hill into a garden, and lived out a commitment to honor Christ in every aspect of their lives by opening their hearts to whatever God wanted to do. It turned out what God had in mind was “keeping”: keeping a house and garden, keeping an open door, keeping a strong marriage, and keeping devotion to those things that are eternal. Meditations about joy and glory and wonder mingle with practical household tips, recipes, and amusing stories about a family that knows how to keep life jolly as readers gain a fresh attentiveness to and perspective on God, nature, and relationships."
