back-text: "“I believe it is possible to live in the rubble of this warring world, to have a life full of pain and disappointment, and still rejoice.” -Joyce Sackett Fifteen years ago, Joyce Sackett opened her daughter's bedroom door and saw the unthinkable: the girl had committed suicide. How does a mother-or anyone-cope with such a devastating loss? Is it really possible to sweep up the shattered pieces of a grieving heart and find healing again? Goodbye Jeanine is a faith journey--from the despair of a family member's suicide back to hope and joy. This poignant and honest account reveals how Sackett learned to survive both physically and emotionally with the mixed emotions of loss, anger, guilt, fear, and shame--and how you can too. Despite tragic circumstances, God is near to the brokenhearted, bringing comfort and joy from grief and pain."
