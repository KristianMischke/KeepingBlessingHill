In Matthew 6:25-34, Jesus invites us to lighthearted living. "Look at the birds," He says. "Look at the lilies." He encourages us to really look, not just glance. He tells us to consider what we see in our wonder-filled world and know that we are more valuable to Him than any of the beautiful things He has made. That being so, I can stop worrying (I'm a pretty good worrier) about the present circumstances of my life. Jesus promises to care for me and provide all my needs as I seek Him and His Kingdom first. I like how Eugene Peterson puts it in The Message:

> Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don't worry about missing out...give your entire attention to what God is doing right now and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the times comes.
