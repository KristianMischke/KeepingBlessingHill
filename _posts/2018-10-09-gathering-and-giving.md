> God is the one who gives seed to the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, He will give you many opportunities to do good, and He will produce a great harvest of generosity in you. **2 Corinthians 9:10 NLT**

As you gather up the last tomatoes and pick the last bouquet, think about how God wants your life to be like a well-kept garden-- beautiful and fruitful. Pray for alertness to opportunities where you can be generous with what God has given you.
