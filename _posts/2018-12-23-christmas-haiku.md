(In case you’ve forgotten, a haiku is a Japanese poetry form having seventeen syllables in three lines of five, seven, and five. I’ve used this pattern for each stanza.)
<br/><br/>
Earth reels: dark, cold, pain.<br/>
Child, bird, seed, taste death daily.<br/>
Hope falls like tree leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Sudden announcement!<br/>
White wings in night-sky. Great news!<br/>
Today, Christ is born!<br/>
<br/>
Sheep keepers shiver.<br/>
They hear: Don’t fear; seek the Babe.<br/>
Star shines on feed trough.<br/>
<br/>
Kings, wizards bow low.<br/>
But Light’s lovely life stirs strife.<br/>
Men hate Light, love dark.<br/>
<br/>
God-Man, healer, good,<br/>
His blood spills through pierced skin.<br/>
Dark world has killed Light.<br/>
<br/>
Grave cannot keep Light.<br/>
Earth shakes, stones move, men fall flat.<br/>
The Light has killed death.<br/>
<br/>
God keeps His promise:<br/>
Forgiven, life eternal:<br/>
Just look at His Son.<br/>
<br/>
Light came; He’s coming.<br/>
Whoever will, may receive.<br/>
Oh, heart, open wide.<br/>
