> This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was Jesus's first display of His glory. And His disciples believed in Him. **John 2:11**

I think of those servants that were told by Jesus to fill six huge water vessels with water. And then Jesus told them to pour some of the water out and take it to the wedding feast master. What a startling moment for those servants. Right before their eyes, real water was turned into real wine. Really good wine! The disciples were watching too, and it was a turning point in their faith. I would have loved to see that miracle. Actually, I do see the same miracle, only in slow motion:

> God creates the vine and teaches it to draw up water by its roots and, with the aid of the sun, to turn that water into a juice which will ferment and take on certain qualities. Thus, every year, from Noah's time till ours, God turns water into wine." C.S. Lewis (See a similar passage in Lewis's book, **Miracles**, page 179, in the Touchstone edition from Simon and Schuster; NY; 1975)

I tell myself to stay awake and alert. What other "miracles" are happening in my garden and in my life? Where am I seeing the power of Jesus Christ at work today, this week?
