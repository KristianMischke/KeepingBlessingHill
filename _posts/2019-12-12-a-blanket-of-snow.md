>Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow… **Isaiah 1:18**

Deep snow covers the brown deadness in the garden. Faded grass and weeds disappear. Dry spikes and sticks and leftover rubble are blanketed with a gentleness that softens all the sharp edges. The garden is quieted and clean again. Gone are all the mistakes of last season’s planting and neglect. Thanks to the snow, the garden and I must rest and gather strength for the next growing season.

The deep, pristine snow is meant to be a picture of the love of God. God has covered our sins completely through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. If we believe in Him, in the Word Who became flesh, and Whose coming to earth we now celebrate, God gives us absolute forgiveness and acceptance. No matter how deep the stain of our sins, God’s love is deeper. It removes the stain and makes us clean as the newly fallen snow.

A new snowfall delights us (or I should say some of us!) We love the way it brings a peace and beauty to our world, the way it slows down our schedule and brings out our playful side. When you next enjoy a deep snow falling on your garden, or see a picture of a snow-covered landscape, let it remind you of the deep love of God for you in His Son, Jesus. He has made it possible for us to have a truly Merry Christmas!
