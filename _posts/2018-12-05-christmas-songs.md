In any community of Christ-followers and at any given time there exists a mix of moods.
Some members will be dancing while others are weeping or perhaps experiencing melancholy.
If, at this celebration-laden time of year, we are suffering from a loss or illness; from an
unexplained dark mood; or if nostalgia has overtaken us⸺a longing for good times past or never
achieved⸺it is just now that we need the joyful songs and sounds of Christmastime.

During advent, our music is full of <i>tidings of comfort and joy!</i>

<i>“There’s a song in the air! There’s a star in the sky…the manger in Bethlehem cradles a
King!”</i>

Christmas carols encourage us to think longer and more deeply about our Lord. The
words of our best carols tell the whole truth of Christmas: our Savior has arrived on earth! We
sing of the “radiant beams” shining from the holy infant face of Jesus. We call to each other in
song,

<i>“Oh, come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant…Come and adore him, Christ our
Lord.... JOY to the world, the Lord is come!”</i>

This Christmas, some of us may not be able to sing with a truthful heart, <i>“Ding dong
merrily a caroling…”</i> Or maybe we can’t quite belt out with a smile, <i>“Fa La La La La…”</i>. But
we can take a long look at our Lord who came as a helpless babe, lived a perfect life and died
nailed to a cross for us and for our salvation. And we can remember his triumphal resurrection.

<i>“What Child is this?...this is Christ the King! . Christ the Babe is Lord of all!</i>

<i>“Light and life to all He brings, risen with healing in His wings.”<i>

Such deliberate dwelling on these facts may yet produce a joyful sound somewhere in our heart
and soul.
