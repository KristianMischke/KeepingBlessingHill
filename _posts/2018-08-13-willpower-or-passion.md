In an essay titled, *To Fashion a Text*,\* Annie Dillard wrote about what writers do,
and why. She said we are all put here on earth to care passionately about
something; that it’s not more willpower that makes writers go to their little rooms
and write:

“What impels the writer is a deep love for and respect for language, for literary
forms, for books. It’s a privilege to muck about in sentences all morning.”

What do I care passionately about? Gardening? Yes. Writing? Yes. It is my
privilege to live in a place where I may keep a garden and have a room of my own
in which I may write. But these and other “passions” of mine are superseded by
this one desire: to know Jesus Christ and to make Him known. My prayer is that in
the time left of what is allotted to me, this desire to know Jesus will remain my
ruling passion.
