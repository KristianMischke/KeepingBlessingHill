My book, *Keeping Blessing Hill- the Story of a Couple Who Converted a Barn, Created a Garden, and Celebrated Home*, is being released today, nationwide, by my publisher, Morgan James Faith! You may now purchase it in your favorite local bookstore. *Keeping Blessing Hill* is also available as an E-Book and as a paperback in most online bookstores. Here’s an excerpt:

> I garden by whim. And a bit of wit. New ideas keep coming. After so many years of working a place, a portrait emerges and exposes the character of the gardener ⸺or maybe just her foibles. I am not aiming for a “world-class” garden, as one local garden was described in our newspaper recently. My garden isn’t classy in any sense. I’ve attempted “artful” and have now arrived at “make do”, since I decided to accept the limitations of my age and ability and our pocketbook. I love garden work because the results are so visible: bushed trimmed, beds weeded, plants dug and replanted in a better spot, debris raked and carted off. I enjoy this good labor though I know I will be stiff and sore the next day. The stiffness doesn’t keep me from choosing to go back out there and work some more. Not yet, anyway.
> Gardening is not a hobby for me. I don’t have hobbies. I have serious reasons (mostly) for the way I spend my time. Calling my garden a hobby seems to belittle it. My garden seems necessary to me for my well-being. I keep a garden for the health of my soul and my body and for the opportunity it gives me every day to see God’s glory growing on this hill.
