Rudyard Kipling wrote that half a proper gardener’s work is done on his knees. A large
part of this lowly work is due to weeds. Weeding is a humble and personal chore. I have to get
down close to the earth, so I can see to pull the weed out by its roots. Or I may need to untangle
the weed from a plant I want to save. As I do the tedious pulling, I also check on my garden’s
condition, the health of plants, the arrival of seedlings. My face is right there close, and I can see
into blossoms and smell the fragrances.

Since I hand-weed my garden, I know what’s in it. I’ve learned by experience and
observation which seedling will become a weed and which is a volunteer marigold seedling,
come to live among the lilies. Even though weeds grow fast and show up in every garden bed, I
am in no hurry. The garden is one place where time seems stilled, where I can be relaxed even as
I work.

Just as weeding keeps me involved and intimate with my garden, praying maintains my
personal relationship with God. I bend my knees and bow my heart, and God allows me to grow
in intimacy with Him. He invites me to enjoy the pleasure of His company. His holiness and love
draw me to Him in humility, worship, and surrender. He puts His hand on my life and touches
those “weeds” that hinder growth, either outright sin or just hindrances. And He instructs me to
weed them out. I confess and repent, and ask for help, and the Lord assures me of His
forgiveness, love, and constant presence. He strengthens my desire to maintain my newly
weeded heart.

A newly weeded garden is a delightful sight. Two weeks ago, several friends helped us
weed many garden beds and other areas on our hill to get it ready for a garden party. No weeds
were left between the bricks on the path, no more weeds lurked among the liriope or around the
garden fence. The whole hill (even behind the garage!) shone because of our friends’ gifts of
hours of weeding. Yesterday I walked around the hill and saw how many weeds were already
back and growing fast. So I will go into the garden today, and kneel as I weed, which is also the
ideal posture for prayer.
