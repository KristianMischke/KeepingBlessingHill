Here's a favorite quote I pinned to the cork board above my desk. It's a synopsis, really, of some of John Owen's profound teaching in his book, *Communion With God*. I read it and it encourages me greatly when I am feeling inadequate as a Christ-follower (which is often). May it encourage you as well:

> Christ bears the iniquity of my holy things, adds incense to my prayers, gathers out all the weeds from my duties, and makes me acceptable to God.
