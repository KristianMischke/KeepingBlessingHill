On Saturday, June 30th, any time between 1-6pm, all are welcome to visit Blessing Hill, stroll around the gardens, find a bench or chair and relax. We'll have some snacks and lemonade and iced tea. I will also have a pre-release sale and signing of my newest book: Keeping Blessing Hill- the story of a couple who converted a barn, created a garden, and celebrated home. Come see us!
