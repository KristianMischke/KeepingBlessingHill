Recently, a tragedy struck very close to home. A young man, known to my daughter and grandchildren, ended his life violently and left behind a crowd of people in our broader Christian community who now bear the heavy burden of grief. ( I am praying for you all.)

Because of this, several people have asked about my book, Goodbye, Jeanine, a mother's faith journey after her daughter's suicide.  Amazon has a number of used copies. I have new copies that I will send to anyone requesting one. The cost is 12$ which includes postage. For anyone in the immediate family of this young man, the book is free.

Email <a href="mailto:joyce.sackett@gmail.com" target="_blank">joyce.sackett@gmail.com</a> with your request and your address and I will promptly get a copy to you in the mail. You may send a check for 12$ to:
