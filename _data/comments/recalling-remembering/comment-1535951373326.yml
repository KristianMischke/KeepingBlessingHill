message: "To Jeannette's comment I would add how significant it is to my husband, Ken, and I to, as Jim said,  \"...relive, recall, remember....\" those times when he demonstrated His faithfulness, or unfailing love, provision, His mercy, enduring presence...and the list goes on and on!  \"...when You rescued me that time...when You saved me....‚Äù  \r\nWe like to refer to this as God's track record in our lives.  A track record may be achieved with one event, but with more succeeding events, such a record becomes a topic of conversation such that people enjoy and become passionate about reliving those victories.  So, after 50-plus years of experiencing God in our lives His track record becomes imbedded, richer, irrefutable.  It is a source of encouragement, of strength.  It offers even greater hope as we approach the finish line in our later years, a cause for great rejoicing and worship.  Forgive me - I have gotten carried away here!!!"
